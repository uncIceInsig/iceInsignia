    <p>The goal of Ice Insignia is simple, defeat your foe in the field of battle. <br><br>
    To do this you have several different fighters to work with. Try and build a team that works well together!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You need two people to play this game</li>
      <li>Login/Register then select your pieces and the items they will carry into battle</li>
      <li>Select the battle field and get ready for war</li>
      <li>One "round" is composed of Player1's "turn" followed by Player2's "turn" </li>
      <li>Once Player1 has moved every piece's move count to 0, it is Player2's turn</li>
      <li>Select a piece you wish to move on your team by clicking on it.</li>
      <li>Once clicked, you can move the selected piece with the arrow keys or user a spell/attack/item</li>
      <li>the "pass" option end's that piece's turn</li>
      <li>To target another piece, select your piece and its attack/spell and then click on the piece you target.</li>
      <li>Watch out! This is real war out here! Do not attack your own team!</li>
